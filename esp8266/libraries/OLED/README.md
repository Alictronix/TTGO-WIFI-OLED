This is an [esp8266-Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) library for I2C-OLED displays.

## Credits

Original code was taken from [ESP8266-I2C-OLED](https://github.com/costonisp/ESP8266-I2C-OLED) project and was modified in form of a library suitable for using with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

## Installation

- Click on the `Download ZIP` button in the top right corner.
- Uncompress it.
- Rename the uncompressed folder to `OLED`.
- Check that the OLED folder contains OLED.cpp and OLED.h files.
- Place the `OLED` folder in your `<arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/` folder - you may need to create the `libraries` subfolder if it is your first library.
- Restart the IDE.
